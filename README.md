⚙️ Installation & SetupThis is a static front-end project and does not require any complex installation or dependencies.1. Clone the Repositorygit clone https://github.com/your-username/anaya-frozen-foods.git
cd anaya-frozen-foods
2. Place Your ImagesEnsure all your product images, the logo (logo.jpeg), and the hero background (hero-background.jpg) are placed inside the images/ folder.3. No DependenciesThere are no external packages to install (like npm or pip). All required libraries (Google Fonts, Font Awesome) are loaded via CDN links in the HTML.▶️ How to Run the ProjectSimply open the index.html file in your favorite web browser (like Google Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).# On Windows, you can use:
start index.html

# On macOS, you can use:
open index.html
Alternatively, you can use a simple web server or the "Live Server" extension in Visual Studio Code for the best experience.🧠 Website Functionality BreakdownThe entire website operates on the client-side using JavaScript to manipulate the DOM.Data Management (script.js):All product information (name, price, image, category, description) is stored in a single JavaScript array of objects called menuItems. This acts as a client-side database, making it easy to add or update products by simply editing this array.Dynamic Rendering (script.js):On page load, the renderMenu() function reads the menuItems array and dynamically generates the HTML for each product card, inserting them into the menu grid. This means you don't have to write repetitive HTML for each product.Event Handling (script.js):The application uses addEventListener to manage all user interactions:Search Bar: Filters the menuItems array based on user input and re-renders the menu.Filter Buttons: Filters the menuItems array by category and re-renders the menu."Add to List" Buttons: Pushes the selected product into a shoppingList array and re-renders the list sidebar.Shopping List Controls: Modifies the shoppingList array (increasing/decreasing quantity, removing items) and updates the view.Dark Mode Toggle: Adds or removes the .dark-mode class from the <body> tag and saves the user's choice to localStorage.🔮 Future EnhancementsThis project provides a solid foundation. The next logical steps to turn this into a full-fledged e-commerce solution are:Headless CMS Integration: Connect the frontend to a Headless CMS (like Sanity.io or Strapi). This would allow the business owner to add, edit, and manage products from a user-friendly admin panel without touching any code.Online Payment Gateway: Integrate a local payment provider (e.g., EasyPaisa, JazzCash) to allow for online pre-payments.Backend & Order Management: Build a simple backend (e.g., with Node.js/Express) to handle incoming orders, which would be displayed in a secure admin dashboard for the owner to track and manage.User Accounts: Allow customers to create accounts to save their details and view their order history.📧 ContactYour Name📫 onedaysuccussfull@gmail.com🌐 LinkedIn: [Your LinkedIn Profile URL]
